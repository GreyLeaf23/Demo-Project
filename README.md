## Motivation


One thing that everything seems to have in common is the rapid change that everything is going under, and card games are no exception.
With so many concepts and mechanics being release, is difficult for players to keep up with all the jargon that the game brings, especially for newer players.

It feels like you're studying the game instead of.... PLAYING IT.

This is the reasoning of creating an experience that allows players to enjoy all the richness that trading card games have to offer, for anyone
of any age and skill!
